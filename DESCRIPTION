Description: Example software intended to provide a tutorial teaching 
	aid for the analysis of data from designed experiments, especially
	agricultural crop experiments. The basics of statistical analysis
	of designed experiments are discussed using real examples from 
	agricultural field trials. A range of statistical methods are 
	exemplified using a range of R statistical packages. The experimental
	data is made available as a separate data set for each example
	and the R analysis code is made available as a set of examples.
	The example R code can be readily extended, as required.
