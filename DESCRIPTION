Description: The package is intended as a teaching aid and 
	supports a tutorial approach to the analysis of experimental data
	for research workers. The basics of the statistical analysis of designed 
	experiments are discussed using real examples from agricultural 
	field trials. Modern statistical methods for the analysis of
	designed experiments assuming various block and treatment structures
	including designs with repeated measurements on the same experimental 
	units are exemplified.
