#' @title  EXAMPLE 1: SPLIT-PLOT DESIGN WITH ONE QUALITATIVE AND ONE QUANTITATIVE LEVEL TREATMENT FACTOR
#' @description
#'#' Gomez & Gomez (1984, p. 143) report a rice experiment with three management practices
#' (minimum, optimum, intensive), five different amounts of nitrogen (N) fertilizer
#' (0, 50, 80, 110, 140 kg/ha), and three varieties (V1, V2, V3). The experiment
#' involved variety and management as qualitative treatment factors and nitrogen
#' fertilizer as a quantitative treatment factor. Overall, there were 45 treatments.
#' The fertilizer treatments were applied to main plots, the management practices to
#' split-plots and the varieties to split-split plots.

#' @details
#' Code
#'
#' The example code shown below can be copied and pasted into a console terminal window
#' and will provide a basic analysis of the rice experiment data (type rice to view the actual rice data).
#'
#' The example code depends on the three packages lmerTest, lsmeans and pbkrtest and these
#' must all be installed on the user machine before the code can be executed.
#' Packages can be installed either by using the commands
#' install.packages('lmerTest'), install.packages('lsmeans') and install.packages('pbkrtest')
#' or by using a tools option in a suitable gui such as RStudio. Sometimes a package depends on other
#' packages for proper installation and if there are warnings about not finding certain named
#' packages then these will need to be installed also.
#'
#' Graphical output should appear in the gui graphics window but, if required, it can be diverted to
#' a suitable pdf file by using a pdf file command. Opening pdf() and closing dev.off()
#' commands are shown hashed-out in the example code but can be copied and pasted without the hashes, if required.
#'
#' Similarly, textual output should appear in the gui terminal window but, if required, it can be diverted to
#' a suitable text file by using a sink file command. Opening and closing sink()
#' commands are shown hashed-out in the example code but can be copied and pasted without the hashes, if required.
#'
#' The ## Not run: and ## End(Not run) comments are irrelevant and can be ignored.
#'
#' Analysis
#'
#' The first step in the analysis is the calculation of polynomial powers of N using the poly() function.
#' As there are 5 levels of N, the maximum possible number of polynomials is four and these have been called
#' linear, quadratic, cubic and quartic polynomials corresponding to the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th powers of N.
#' The powers of the high N in the original scale of measurement are large and the N rates have
#' been divided by 100 to provide improved numerical stability. Significance tests are unaffected by re-scaling
#' but the coefficients and standare errors of the polynomial coefficients will be multiplied by 100 raised to
#' the degree of the corresponding polynomial.
#'
#' The polynomials used in this analysis are 'raw' polynomials which means that they are the actual powers of the
#' actual N rate values. Raw polynomials are simple to use but it is important
#' to remember that raw polynomials are not mutually orthogonal and that the order of fitting of the model terms
#' is important. For polynomial models there is a natural order of fitting
#' of polynomial effects from the lowest to the highest degree so there can never any ambiguity
#' in the order of fitting of the polynomial terms.
#'
#' Table 1 shows a full analysis of variance and displays the sources of variation corresponding to the
#' different types of experimental units to which the treatment factor levels were applied
#' i.e. main plots (for nitrogen), split-plots (for management) and split-split plots (for variety).
#' Each different type of experimental unit (or "stratum") requires a separate error term in the model.
#'
#' Table 2 shows a summary of the treatment means for various marginal classifications of the treatment factors
#' averaged over all the other treatment factors, together with estimated se's for pairwise comparisons of
#' treatment means. The 'lsmeans' package was used for calculating the marginal tables of means and the standard errors.
#'
#' Table 3 shows a mixed model analysis of the full factorial model fitted by REML using the lmer function
#' of the lme4 package (lmerTest provides the same functionality but with the addition of
#' significance tests). Generally with mixed models, determination of the denominator degrees of freedom for
#' Wald-type F- and t-statistics becomes an issue, and here we use the method proposed by Kenward & Roger (1997).
#'
#' Table 7 shows a mixed model analysis similar to Table 3 but with the nitrogen treatment effects
#' decomposed into polynomial effects to provide precise information about the nitrogen treatment
#' comparisons. Normally, quantitative factor effects can be explained by low-degree polynomials
#' and in this analysis most of the nitrogen treatment effects are explained by linear and quadratic trend effects.
#' However, it is important to note that the Variety x Cubic N interaction effect is non-negligible and has a
#' significant Wald F-test. This indicates that not all the varieties responded in a similar way to
#' the N treatments and that some further analysis of the data may be required (see also the N plots for individual
#' varieties and replicates in Fig 1). Note that the management effects are assumed additive throughout this analysis.
#'
#' Table 8 shows the fitted model for estimating the actual coefficients of the the nitrogen model. Models for estimating
#' effects should include only those terms that are significant for the fitted model therefore only the linear and
#' quadratic nitrogen trend terms are included in this model. The fitted model for the nitrogen effects fits the
#' actual actual nitrogen levels used in the experiment as these provide the simplest interpretation of the
#' nitrogen effects.
#'
#' Fig 1 shows individual plots of the nitrogen response for each variety in each block averaged over management effects.
#' Unlike the single plot shown in Piepho and Edmondson (2017), these plots show the nitrogen response of the individual
#' variety effects in each replicate block separately. These plots show some evidence of anomalous behaviour by variety 1
#' in blocks 1 and 2 compared with block 3 and, in practice, this anomaly would need to be investigated by further
#' discussions with research workers. Without such further discussions, there is little more that can be done to explain
#' this anomaly.
#'
#' The final graphical figure show a scatter plot of the residuals from the full fitted model. Checking model assumptions and
#' model fit is always vitally important for a reliable analysis and a scatter plot of fitted residuals should always be the
#' first test of any fitted model. Many more options for model testing are available and further methods for diagnostic testing
#' will be examined in the subsequent examples.
