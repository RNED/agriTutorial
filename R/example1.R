#' @title  EXAMPLE 1: SPLIT-PLOT DESIGN WITH ONE QUALITATIVE AND ONE QUANTITATIVE LEVEL TREATMENT FACTOR
#'
#' @description
#' Gomez & Gomez (1984, p. 143) report a rice experiment with three management practices
#' (minimum, optimum, intensive), five different amounts of nitrogen (N) fertilizer
#' (0, 50, 80, 110, 140 kg/ha), and three varieties (V1, V2, V3). The experiment
#' involved variety and management as qualitative treatment factors and nitrogen
#' fertilizer as a quantitative treatment factor. Overall, there were 45 treatments.
#' The fertilizer treatments were applied to main plots, the management practices to
#' split-plots and the varieties to split-split plots.
#'
#' @details
#'
#' The first stage of the analysis calculates a full set of four raw polynomials for the 5-levels of N using
#' the poly() function. The N rates are re-scaled by division by 100 to improve numerical stability.
#'
#' The second stage calculates a full analysis of variance (Table 1) for main plots (nitrogen), split-plots
#' (management) and split-split plots (variety). Each type of experimental unit (or "stratum") requires
#'  a separate error term in the fitted analysis.
#'
#' The next stage (Table 2) uses REML mixed model analysis to find treatment means and SE's for each marginal
#' treatment classification averaged over all the other treatment factors, together with estimates of
#' pairwise contrasts of treatment means and the SE' of each pairwise treatment comaparison.
#'
#' The third stage (Table 3) shows a mixed model analysis of the full factorial model fitted by REML using the lmer function
#' of the lme4 package. Generally with mixed models, determination of the denominator degrees of freedom for
#' Wald-type F- and t-statistics becomes an issue, and here we use the method proposed by Kenward & Roger (1997).
#'
#' Table 7 shows a mixed model polynomial analysis of nitrogen effects assuming additive management effects.
#' In this analysis, most of the nitrogen treatment effect can be explained by linear and quadratic trend effects.
#' but it is important to note that there is a non-negligible Variety x Cubic N interaction effect. This suggests
#' that not all the varieties responded in a similar way to
#' the N treatments and that some further analysis of the data may be required (see the N plots for individual
#' varieties and replicates in Fig 1).
#'
#' Table 8 shows the fitted model for estimating the actual coefficients of the the nitrogen model. Models for estimating
#' effects should include only those terms that are significant for the fitted model therefore only the linear and
#' quadratic nitrogen trend terms are included in this model. The fitted model for the nitrogen effects fits the
#' actual actual nitrogen levels used in the experiment as these provide the simplest interpretation of the
#' nitrogen effects.
#'
#' Fig 1 shows individual plots of the nitrogen response for each variety in each block averaged over management effects.
#' Unlike the single plot shown in Piepho and Edmondson (2017), these plots show the nitrogen response of the individual
#' variety effects in each replicate block separately. These plots show some evidence of anomalous behaviour by variety 1
#' in blocks 1 and 2 compared with block 3 and, in practice, this anomaly would need to be investigated by further
#' discussions with research workers. Without such further discussions, there is little more that can be done to explain
#' this anomaly.
#'
#' The final graphical figure show a scatter plot of the residuals from the full fitted model. Checking model assumptions and
#' model fit is always vitally important for a reliable analysis and a scatter plot of fitted residuals should always be the
#' first test of any fitted model. Many more options for model testing are available and further methods for diagnostic testing
#' will be examined in the subsequent examples.
